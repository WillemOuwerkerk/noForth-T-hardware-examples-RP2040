\ Basic nRF24 bidirectional RECEIVE routine
\
\ Recieve T, increase counter & transmit : and counter back
\
\ Extra words: MS
\ *BIS    ( mask addr -- )    Set the bits represented by mask at address
\ *BIC    ( mask addr -- )    Clear the bits represented by mask at address
\ *BIX    ( mask addr -- )    XOR the bits represented by mask with the bits at address
\ B-B     ( 16-bit -- bl bh ) Split 16-bit to a low byte & high byte
